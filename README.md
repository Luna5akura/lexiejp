## Usage/Examples

First, you need a Renshuu account. Renshuu is a free application and website for learning Japanese. This project is made with Rust and Docker.

### 1. You need your API key to Run the bot

Since the bot is based on the public API of the application (link of the public API [here](https://api.renshuu.org/docs/)), the requests have to include your API key in the request header (Authorize field).

- **On mobile** (since the homepage)
    1. Method 1: **click** on the three bars at the top left corner. **Select** the "Tools" element, and **click** on "renshuu API". Your API key will be displayed here. *If it does not, just check the second method.*
    2. Method 2: **click** on the three bars at the top left corner. **Click** on the gear. **Select** the "Experimental" option into the category dropdown. Just scroll a bit and you will see the key.

- **On desktop** (since the homepage), the way is kind of the same.
    1. Method 1: **click** on the "Resources" header. **Select** the "renshuu API" option in the dropdown. Your token will be displayed here. *If it does not work, just check the second method.*

### 2. Once you got your API key

You just have to copy it and put it into the /register command (don't forget to add the bot [with this link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1278404960685654117) or to use it in a Discord server where the bot is present).
